# APTOS-2019-Blindness-Detection
✤ Problem: Multi-label image classification. ✤The training data set consists of 3662 scanned retina images as input and gives out a number between 0–4 based on the severity of blindness (target label). ✤ Data preprocessing: converts images into RGB, resizes the image into 128X128 pixels and a Gaussian filter is applied. ✤ Augmentation: Rotate, vertical/horizontal flip, blur lighting and cropping. ✤ Model: build a Convolutional Neural Network - CNN. Applied a couple of models, such as DenseNet121, ResNet50 and Efficient Net -B4 architecture. ✤ Performance Metrics: Weighted Kappa Score and Confusion Matrix.✤ Results: Validation Kappa 92% (Effnet-B4).
